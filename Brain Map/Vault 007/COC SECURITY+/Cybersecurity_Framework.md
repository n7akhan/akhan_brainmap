# Cybersecurity Framework

The **Cybersecurity Framework**, developed by the **National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, provides a structured way to
manage and improve information security. It breaks cybersecurity tasks
into **five key functions**:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. **Identify**

-   Develop **security policies** and **capabilities**.\
-   Evaluate **risks, threats, and vulnerabilities**.\
-   Recommend **security controls** to mitigate them.

*Example:* Performing a risk assessment to determine which systems are
most critical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. **Protect**

-   Procure, develop, install, operate, and decommission **IT hardware
    and software** securely.\
-   Make security an **embedded requirement** throughout the
    **operations life cycle**.

*Example:* Using encryption to protect sensitive data or applying access
controls to limit who can use certain resources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. **Detect**

-   Perform **ongoing, proactive monitoring**.\
-   Ensure controls are **effective** and capable of identifying **new
    types of threats**.

*Example:* Using intrusion detection systems (IDS) or continuous log
monitoring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. **Respond**

-   Identify, analyze, contain, and **eradicate threats**.\
-   Ensure **business continuity** while minimizing damage.

*Example:* Activating an incident response plan after a phishing attack
is detected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. **Recover**

-   Implement **cybersecurity resilience**.\
-   Restore **systems and data** if other controls fail.\
-   Learn from incidents to strengthen security.

*Example:* Restoring data from backups after a ransomware attack and
updating security policies to prevent recurrence.

# ðŸ”‘ Summary

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework helps organizations by:\
- **Identifying** what needs protection.\
- **Protecting** assets proactively.\
- **Detecting** potential threats early.\
- **Responding** effectively to attacks.\
- **Recovering** quickly and improving resilience.

This cycle is **continuous**, meaning security must be **regularly
updated and improved** as threats evolve.
