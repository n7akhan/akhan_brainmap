+ no system can never be 100% hack proof
+ **ZERO day vulnerability** are vulnerability that have not been found yet.   
+ **NON Repudiation** means you are attributing an action or system to someone that cannot be denied. We have evidence that cannot be denied


**NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) : an organization that sets the standards for cybersecurity**

+ Cybersecurity Framework: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover

**ROLES**

CISO (Chief information Security Officer): Overall responsibility of security organization.
ISSO (Information System Security Officer): Workers, comply with policies

SOC (Security Operation Center): Operational Arm of an organization, they detect threats and act on it. Looks for IOC (indicators of  Compromise).

CERT: Within SOC they are the response to threats. 

DEV OPS vs DEV SEC OPS:  life cycle of a program, how software is developed, in dev ops I use and develop program code. I wanna always automate this program to heal it self if compromised, its all automated. DEV SECURITY OPS MEANS you are looking into the whole life cycle of the program with security in mind. 

**SECUIRTY CONTROLS!**
A control is something we do to protect our system.


TECHNICAL SECUIRTY CONTROL: control implemented through hardware, software, firmware

OPERATIONAL SECUIRTY CONTROL: Control by people, humans rather then systems, two man rule

MANAGAREAIL SECURITY CONTROL: Control through management. Oversight, monitor over people, kind of like non repudiation, see what people are doing, accountability.
