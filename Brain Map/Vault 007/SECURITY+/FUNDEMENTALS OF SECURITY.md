# **THE BALANCE


+ We gives end users (people) security but they want convenience. So we give up security for convenience. 
+ We increase security we lose the convenience!
+ We fight this balance all the time in organization. 

# **TWO KEY TERMS**

**1) INFORMATION SECUITY** : *Act of protecting data and information from unauthorized modification and disruption, disclosure, and corruption and destruction.*

+ We talk about the **DATA** the system is holding but not the system themselves. 

**2)  INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY** : Act of protecting the systems that hold and process the critical data

+ The computer, server, network device, smartphone, that **HOLDS THE DATA**

# **CIA TRIAD (3 pillars of Security) OLD 

==**CONFIDENTIALITY**== : Ensures that information is only accessible to those with the appropriate authorization

+ If you encrypt sensitive files that only authorized can decrypt and read them

==**INTERGRITY**== : Ensures data remains accurate and unaltered unless modification is required

+ **Checksums** can be used to see if a file has not been changed or corrupted

==**AVAILABILTY**== : Ensures information and resources are accessible and functional when needed by authorized users 

+ When you implement redundancy measures to ensure a website remains online and up anytime regardless of how much traffic is hitting the website and high and low traffic

==========================================================

# CIANA Pentagon (5 pillars of security ) NEW


==**NON-REPUDIATION**== : Guaranteeing that a specific action or event has taken place and cannot be denied by the parties involved

+ If I send and email and I sign it digitally, I cannot deny it since I signed it! 

==**AUTHENTICATION==** : This is part of CIANA but has 3 sub parts. 

**THE TRIPLE AAA of SECURITY**
	1) ==**Authentication**:== Process of verifying the identity of a user or a system. 
		-When logging into email your username and password gets checked against stored versions of those username and password
	2) ==**Authorization:**== Defines what actions or resources users can access
		-Determines what actions and resources an authenticated users has permissions to perform such READ AND WRITE PERMISSIONS
	3) ==**Accounting:**== Act of tracking user activities and resource usage, typically for audit or billing purposes.
		-When you log on we log what YOU are doing to monitor them for unusual behaviors.

==========================================================

# **SECURITY CONTROLS**

Measures and mechanisms put in place to mitigate risks and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems and data. 

**THESE CAN BE GROUPED SUCH AS**

1) Technical
2) Managerial 
3) Operational
4) Physical

**DIFFERENT ==TYPES== OF SECURITY CONTROLS**

1) Preventative
2) Deterrent
3) Detective
4) Corrective
5) Compensating
6) Directive

# **CONCEPT OF ZERO TRUST**

Security model that operates on the principle that no one, whether inside or outside the organization, should be trusted by default. 

In order to get Zero Trust we need to use **CONTROL PLANE** and **DATA PLANE**

1) **CONTROL PLANE** : Consists of the adaptive identity, threat scope reduction, policy driven access control and secured zones. 
2) **DATA PLANE** : Focused on the subject/system, policy engine, policy administrator, and establishing policy enforcement points.
