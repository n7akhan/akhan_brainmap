We use security controls spread across 4 categories to secure systems.

1) ***Technical Control:*** Technologies, Hardware, and software mechanisms that are implemented to manage and reduce risks. For example, an anti virus software or fi rewalls, encryption processes and intrusion detection systems. 
2) **Managerial Controls***: Involve the strategic planning and governance side of security. They get the yes or no through risk assessments.  
3) ***Operational Controls:*** Governed by humans. 30 day password changes. User awareness training programs. 
4) ***Physical Controls:*** Tangible, real world measures taken to protect assets. Camera's, doors and security cards. 

ALL THESE COME TOGETHER TO PILAR UP SECUIRTY!

# **TYPES OF CONTROLS**

1) ***Preventative Controls:*** Proactive measures implemented to thwart potential security threats or breaches. Like a firewall to protect a system way before a threat happens, PREVENT damage.
2) ***Deterrent Controls**:* Aim to discourage potential attackers by making the effort seem less appealing or more challenging. Putting up signs of cameras around the house, it will have them walk away or security at retail. Warning signs or banners. 
3) ***Detective Controls**:* Monitor and Alert Organization to malicious activities as they occur or shortly thereafter. Security cameras in my house, see who it is and tell the police. WE use IDC (Intrusion Detection System) to scan for suspicious activity. 
4) ***Corrective Controls**:* Mitigate any potential damage and restore the system to their normal state. If we have virus, we use anti virus to DETECT the virus then when we quarantine and remove it we use CORRECTIVE CONTROL
5) ***Compensating Controls**:* Alternative measure that are implemented when primary security controls are not feasible or effective. Sometimes you have to compensate down to lower software to make do with what you have.
6) ***Directive Controls:*** Often rooted in policy or documentation and set the standards for behavior within an organization. Guidelines to see how employees will use company assets. 

**EEFECTIVE SECUIRTY IS CREATED BY USING WIDE RANGE OF CONTROLS! EACH CONTROL TYPES COMPLIMENTS EACH OTHER.**
